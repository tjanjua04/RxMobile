# RxMobile


RxMobile is a mobile app designed to help medical patients or anyone taking medication keep track of their medications. This app is an easy-to-use tool 
to help medical patients and caretakers manage a prescription regimen by notifying the user when to take pills, how many, and when to order a refill. 
The app will use usersâ€™ mobile phone cameras to scan their prescription receipts, add them to our database, and provide the user with information about 
the scanned prescription. The app also includes a log of previously used medication to organize prescription journals better.
